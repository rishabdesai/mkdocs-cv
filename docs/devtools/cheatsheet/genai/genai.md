# AI (Artificial Intelligence)

- Intelligence = ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills
- Automation = performing task without human invervention
- Adaptability = learning from data and improving over time

---

* AI = Artificial Intelligence
  - mimic human behavior 
* ML = Machine Learning
  - statistical methods
* DL = Deep Learning
  -  uses neural networks
  - ANN = Artificial Neural Network
    - CNN = Convolutional Neural Networks (for image classification)
    - RNN = Recurrent Neural Networks (for text classification/ manupilation)
  - NLP = Natural Language Programming
    - LLM (Large Language Models)

---

* Generative AI = Subset of AI that focuses on creating artificial agents that can generate text, images, music etc

- ML is part of AI
- DL is part of ML
- GenAI is part of DL

## ML  (Machine Learning)
> It is science of programming computers so that they can learn from data.

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning   

### Supervised Learning:

- Type of ML where the model (formula / Logic) is trained on labelled data (Table having dependent variable/column)
- The goal is to learn a general rule that can predict the output of new, unseen input data.
- Regression and Classification
  
---

- Given data = Actual data, observed data, fact data, truth data.
- Given data has two parts
  - independent data (input data, , labeled data, x )
  - dependent data (output data, predictor variable, y )

#### Regression:

- Used for prediction / forcasting
- It is a statistical method
- use for predicting value of continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables
- process for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables
- Algorithms - Linear & multi linear regression

##### Linear Regression
- basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis
- 

#### Classification:

- Used for prediction
- Technique that involves training a model to predicting a categorical label of object. 
- category = labels = classes
- Algorithms - decision tree, logistic regression


### Unsupervised Learning

- unlabelled data
- It tries to find out patterns, structure or relationship within the data on its own.
- No prediction only grouping
- use for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Algorithms - Clustering, Association rule, Dimensional reduction
