# AI (Artificial Intelligence)

- Intelligence = ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills
- Automation = performing task without human invervention
- Adaptability = learning from data and improving over time

---

* AI = Artificial Intelligence
  - mimic human behavior 
* ML = Machine Learning
  - statistical methods
* DL = Deep Learning
  -  uses neural networks
  - ANN = Artificial Neural Network
    - CNN = Convolutional Neural Networks (for image classification)
    - RNN = Recurrent Neural Networks (for text classification/ manupilation)
  - NLP = Natural Language Programming
    - LLM (Large Language Models)

---

* Generative AI = Subset of AI that focuses on creating artificial agents that can generate text, images, music etc

- ML is part of AI
- DL is part of ML
- GenAI is part of DL

## ML  (Machine Learning)
> It is science of programming computers so that they can learn from data.

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning   

### Supervised Learning:

- Type of ML where the model (formula / Logic) is trained on labelled data (Table having dependent variable/column)
- The coal is to learn a general rule that can predict the output of new, unseen input data.
- Regression and Classification
